As some may know i host nearly all my services at home on my home server. 

Starting 3 years ago i ordered my first server and began learning how to use command line and the proper practices that need to be used in a production environment. Currently I now have 4 servers in my home rack running websites, game servers and media services (plex).

<p class="header-footer">My DL380p</p>
<br>
In the rack i have my DL380p G8 which runs Proxmox (debain based KVM hypervisor) that runs nearly all my services including this blog! It currently has 6 128gb samsung sata SSDs in raid 6 giving me a throughput of up to 3 Gigabytes per second reads and writes, with too many I/Os per second to count.

<p>Full specs: Dual Xeon E5-2643 V2s (12 cores 24 threads total at 3.5GHz - 3.8GHz) 96GB of 1366MHz DDR3 ecc registered, and 6 128gb SSDs in hardware raid 6.</p>

<br>
Secondly i have my fujitsu TX150 S7 that runs my storage for the plex VM iâ€™m hoping to replace this soon by just adding more drives to the DL380p as nothing else runs on the server meaning its quite waistfull.

The Final server is the Dell R320 that runs PFsense for all my networking needs. It currently runs 3 subnets home/guest my server network and one for my friends, it also has vpn connections for remote access/management.

<p class="header-footer">VPS</p>
<br>
Finaly every website and service is proxied through my OVH VPS even though this costs me each month to run it adds ddos protection. 
Full specs: 2 Vcores, 4gb of ram and 40gb of SSD storage.

<p class="header-footer">Upgrades for the future!</p>
<br>
In the future im looking at moving all my storage onto the my HP DL380p, and getting a new network switch that supports the TP-Link omada Eco System.
