Just a simple post showing off the custom login page and post creation page!

Its fairly simple and made in php (first time coding php) and it uses mysql to store the post name, post ID (primary Key) and the post date.

The passwords are stored in another table in the DB and the password was hashed before adding it to the database for extra security!

Content of the posts is stored in .txt files and supports markdown.
